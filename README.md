# BrewFinder


## Overview

Welcome to Brew Finder!! My team has created a website for the everyday beer lovers.
You will first see articles from The Guardian scrolling by in the carousel which will
pull up the ten most relevent articles about breweries they have. If you click on any 
one of the healine it will open a new tab for you and take you to the article page. Once 
you have some information you can then scroll down and enter either a brewery key word, 
the state you are in, or the city and it will list ten breweries in those parameters.
The list will give you the name, number, address, and if permitted a user friendly 
map for you. We have also included a learn more page which includes some fun facts about
beers and also information on different types of beers. Finally we included a contact page
of all the developers involved with our github link. Thank you for checking out our site!
